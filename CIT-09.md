# Introduction to Physical Security
- Physical barriers are essential in any organization
- Cybersecurity is irrelevant if anyone can walk into the server room and steal or damage the server.
- Physical security must be layered for maximum protection
## Phyiscal Security Goals
- Provide a safe environment for all assets
- Both intruders and natural disasters must bet aken itn oaccount
- The most important asset will always be human life
    - Assets are people, intellectual property, information, equipment, IIT infrastructure, facilities, etc.
## Defense in Layers
- A crucial aspect of physical security
- an invader can manueverer around a single layer of controls
- There must be a next layer of controls that can help stop the invader from advancing further.

# Access Control
- **Identification**
- User-Activated Reader = the user is active in identification and authorization. Actions can include swiping a card, entering a PIN, and biometric identification.
- System Sensor Access Control Reader = The reader senses an approaching object and scans for a card or token. This type of reader is known as a transponder.
    - passive RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification) only requires proximity to a reader and does not require a battery.
## First Line of Defense
- Provides a psychological deterrent
- Different gauges and mesh sizes are used for different levels of security
    - The perimeter intrusiion detection and assessment system ( PIDAS) fencing method is also known as a smart fence.
## Bollards
- Prevents vehicles from accessing restricted areas
- placed between a faciliity and a parking lot or roads that run close to exterior walls.
## Lighting
- Lights should be installed w/ overlapping zones.
- More light should be used at entrances, less light at guard locations
- Light redundancy should be implemented in case of a power outage
    - Poorly lit or unlit areas invite trespassers.
## Motion Detection
- Eletrical device that detects object motions
- Alerts staff by triggering alarms ( silent or audible)
## Facility Access Control
- Facilities = should be grouped in segments with each segment or area having its own purpose and access controls
- Locks = serve as delaying mechanisms for intruders. They vary in strength, quality, and functionality.
    - Access control mechanisms should maintain an audit trail of authorized and unauthroized entry attempts.
## Administrative Responsibilties
- the right type of lock should match its purpose
- locks and keys require sheduled maintenance to prevent deterioration.
    - Written procedures should be followed for key distribution and management.
## Circumventing Locks
- Locks can be picked in many ways: raking, rocking, bumping, zipping, and more.
- Determined intruders may use power tools or even attempt to dismantle the door.
# Surveillance
- Its continuous monitoring, and sometimes physical action, in surveyed areas
- Facilities should remain under serveillance to ensure swift reaction to intrusions.
## CCTV
- detects,follows, and exposes intruders
- can operate in internal and exterrnal facility areas
- must be integrated w/ other security controls
## CCTV Components
- Camera
- Transmitter
- Receiver
- Recording System ( DVR)
- Monitor
# Intrusion Detection System
- What is a Physical IDS?
- A perimeter-scanning device
- Sensitive to changes in the environment
- can detect a wide variety of changes
## IDS Type
- Electromechanical Systems = Detect changes or breaks in a circuit, can be a magnetic contact switch, pressure plate, etc.
- Photoelectric/Photometric Systems = Emit beams of light and generate alarms when the beam is interrupted
- Passive Infrared Systems = Monitor room temperature and report when the temperature rises
- Acoustic Detection Systems = Highly sensitive microphones that detect possible forced entry sounds
- Wave-Pattern Motion Detectors = Generate wave patterns, transmit them to receivers, and if the returned pattern is different, an intruder is likely present.
- Proximity/Capacitance Detectors = Emit magnetic fields and generate alarms if the field is disrupted.
# Patrol Forces
## Security Guards
- **Pros**
- can help prevent tailgaiting ( piggy-backing)
- Used as a deterrent
- Training and exercises
- Procedures required
- **Cons**
- most expensive form of control
- armed or not?
- fixed patrol location
- vulnerable to social engineering attacks
## Guard Dogs
- Trainable, extremely loyal
- have extraordinary sense of smell/hearing
- considered a supplementary security measure
# Auditing Physical Access
## Access Logs
- Examined to reveal attempts to breach entry points in the facility
- should be reviewed periodically by the facility manager.
    - althoiugh not a preventive measure, logs are often used in cybersecurity forensics investigations.
## Logged Information
- Dates and times of attempts to access the facility
- Facility entry point events
- IDs of individuals who attempt to breach the facility
    - Both successful and unsuccessful attempts are recorded.
## Auditing Permissions
- Roles of personnel change
- Zero trust policy
- Mandatory vacation
    - the threats are both outside and inside.
# Securing the Physical Structure
## Natural Access Control
- guiding people to the desired entrance of a facility via indirect means
- landscaping, light placement, fences, and doors indicate where people can and cannt go.
## Physical Security Plan
- Construction Materials
- Power Distribution Systems
- Communication Types
- External Factors
    - When planning physical security, the elements above must be considered.
## Facility Considerations
- Proximity to emergency services
- Urban and natural camouflage
- Electronic eavesdropping
## Window Types
- Standard windows : very low level of protection
- Non-glass windows (arcylic): better protection
- Laminated or wire layer : best protection
# Physical Security Threats & Solutions
## Shoulder Surfing
- Drones = Drones can be used for shoulder surfing or facility reconnaissance.
- Mitigation: use tinted windows
- Open Space = Placing employees in an open space makes them vulnerable to shoulder surfing
- Mitigation: Use anti-glare screns.
## Access Control
- Access card Duplication = employees card can be duplicated
- mitigation: special wallets that block RFID
- Tailgating/piggy-backing = following behind an authorized user into a facility
- mitgation: posting a guard can deter this behavior
    - 2FA can also be implemented via physical security.
## Physical Approach
- Connecting a USB device to a computer to run malware
- Connecting a laptop to a switch to gain network access
- data theft of documents or otehr valuable assets
    - Facility segregation should be designed to reduce the risk of an attacker freely entering an area.
## Natural Disasters
- Earthqueakes
- Tsunamis
- Hurricances, Typhoons, Cyclones
- Volcanic Eruptions
- Wildfires
## Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear disaster
- a 7.0 magnitude earthquake followed by a 128-foot tsunami
- the tsunami disabled the power supply and cooling systems of three reactors.
- all three cores melted during the first three days.
